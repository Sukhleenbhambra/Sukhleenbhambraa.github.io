## Day 1 at Ryaaz
Today I learned various things and I really enjoyed every moment in the process.
**Firstly** I learned how to access the system configurations.
It is done by going to "settings" and clicking "about"
**Secondly** I learned to install github and learnt necessary terms and concepts.
We have to create repositary and branch.
The next step is to make and commit changes,open a pull request and merge it.
The last task is to create a blog.the following steps are:
Name and create repositary and customize accordingly and hence edit config.yml and index.md file.
at last the settings are updated.


```tsql
 SELECT *
 FROM sys.tables
 WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
 ```
