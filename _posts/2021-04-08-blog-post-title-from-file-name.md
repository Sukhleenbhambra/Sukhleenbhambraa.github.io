Well ,today I gained some knowlegde regarding a new language called **HTML**

HTML-**_ HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE_**

I was able to grasp the concepts of HTML elements as given below:
1. _THE BODY_

It is one of the key elements we use to build a web page.

It is organised as a collection of family tree relationships.

3. _HEADINGS_

There are total six different heading elements where h1 is the main heading wheras others are called sub headings.

4._DIVISION_

It is a container that divides pages into sections.it is great for grouping elements.

5._ATTRIBUTES_

Content added to opening tag of an element and can be used in different ways.COMMENLY USED IS **id**

6. _DISPLAYING TEXT_ and  _STYLING TEXT_

**_p_** is for paragraph and contain block of plain text wheras **_span_** is udes to target specific piece of context wheras we use **_em_** for emphasing text in ( _italics_) and **_strong_** in ( **Bold**) for important text.

7._UNORDERED AND ORDERED LISTS_

**ul** is used to create a list of items in no paticular order. wheras **ol**is used where each list item is numbered.
